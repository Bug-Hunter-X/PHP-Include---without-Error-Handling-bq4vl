This code uses a non-standard way to include files using the include() function without checking its return value. If the included file does not exist or has errors, the code may unexpectedly stop or produce incorrect results.  This can be hard to debug because the error message isn't always obvious.
```php
include 'some_file.php';
//Continue executing code here...
